# Multi-Agent ROMA Workflow Hub

A simple **multi-agent workflow demo** that simulates breaking a goal into tasks, executing them, and reviewing results. Built for **Sentient Builder L2 submission**.  

This version uses a **mock Planner** so it runs without OpenAI API calls, perfect for demo recording.
